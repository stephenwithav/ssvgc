SSVG renderer.


### What is SSVG?

Stupidly Simple Vector Graphics.

Think of it as SVG.

Minus the parts that haven't been implemented yet.

Like scalability.

And Gradients.


### Why SSVG?

Constraints drive Creativity.

### Seriously, why SSVG?

SVG contains both simple and complex elements.

Sometimes, simple is all you need.

SSVG is for those times.


### Here's what really happened.

A subset of SVG is all that's needed to move forward on a few projects.

Implementing the extraneous features would distract me from those projects.

SSVG helps me move forward more quickly.
